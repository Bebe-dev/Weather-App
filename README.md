# WEATHER FORECAST APPLICATION

## About
This app is used to check the weather forecast of a location. On loading the site, it automatically loads the weather forecast of the user's location. Furthermore, you can search for various cities. 
With the app, you get the hourly weather forecast of the entire day. Also included is the 5 days forecast. 

## What I learnt
I was able to practice consuming API after a while. Using Axios made that quite easy for me to do. It was challenging for me as this is the first time I will be using this particular API and the documentation was not very understandable. I also got to use the geolocation feature successfully. However, I was not able to store the weather data in the localStorage but I intend to keep working on it and some other intended features
